## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Data Aggregation by Account
- Groups all transactions by account number
- Handles multiple accounts per customer (joint accounts)
- Deduplicates transactions using transaction IDs

### 2. Transaction Categories (6 Types)
| Category | Direction | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Transfers Sent | Outgoing | Money sent to other accounts |
| Transfers Received | Incoming | Money received from other accounts |
| Deposits | Incoming | Cash deposits to account |
| Withdrawals | Outgoing | Cash withdrawals from account |
| Savings Interest | Incoming | Interest on savings balance |
| FD Interest | Incoming | Interest from fixed deposits |

### 3. Computed Totals for Each Category
For each transaction category:
- **Count**: Number of transactions
- **Total Amount**: Sum of all transaction amounts

### 4. Net Balance Calculations
```javascript
current_balance: Current savings balance (from DB)
net_balance: Current balance (can be enhanced with pending txns)
total_fd_amount: Sum of all linked FD amounts
net_transaction_flow: 
  (deposits + transfers_received + savings_interest + fd_interest)
  - (withdrawals + transfers_sent)
```

### 5. Fixed Deposit Integration
- Lists all FDs linked to each savings account
- Includes FD amounts, start dates, and maturity dates
- Computes total FD investment per account

## 🔌 API Endpoint

**URL:** `GET /api/customer/getCustomerDetails/:nic`

**Authorization:** Bearer token (role: customer)

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "customer_nic": "string",
  "total_accounts": number,
  "accounts": [
    {
      "account_no": "string",
      "role": "primary|secondary",
      "savings_balance": number,
      "savings_status": "string",
      "fixed_deposits": [...],
      "transactions": {
        "transfers_sent": [...],
        "transfers_received": [...],
        "deposits": [...],
        "withdrawals": [...],
        "savings_interest": [...],
        "fd_interest": [...]
      },
      "summary": {
        "current_balance": number,
        "net_balance": number,
        "total_fd_amount": number,
        "transaction_totals": {
          "transfers_sent": { count, total_amount },
          "transfers_received": { count, total_amount },
          "deposits": { count, total_amount },
          "withdrawals": { count, total_amount },
          "savings_interest": { count, total_amount },
          "fd_interest": { count, total_amount }
        },
        "net_transaction_flow": number
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🧮 Calculation Logic

### Net Transaction Flow Formula
```
Net Flow = Incoming - Outgoing

Incoming = Deposits + Transfers Received + Savings Interest + FD Interest
Outgoing = Withdrawals + Transfers Sent

Net Flow = (Deposits + TransfersIn + SavingsInt + FDInt) - (Withdrawals + TransfersOut)
```

This shows whether money is flowing into or out of the account overall.

### Example Calculation
```
Deposits: 10,000
Transfers Received: 2,000
Savings Interest: 250
FD Interest: 0
Withdrawals: 2,000
Transfers Sent: 5,000

Net Flow = (10,000 + 2,000 + 250 + 0) - (2,000 + 5,000)
Net Flow = 12,250 - 7,000
Net Flow = +5,250 (positive = net gain)
```

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

### Quick Fetch Example
```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  `http://localhost:3000/api/customer/getCustomerDetails/${nic}`,
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  }
);
const data = await response.json();
```

### Display Ideas
1. **Dashboard Cards**
   - Current Balance (large, prominent)
   - Total FD Amount
   - Net Transaction Flow (with color coding)

2. **Transaction Breakdown**
   - Pie chart of income vs expenses
   - Bar chart by category
   - Timeline of transactions

3. **Account Summary**
   - List all accounts with balances
   - Show primary/secondary role
   - Link to detailed transaction history

4. **Financial Insights**
   - Total interest earned
   - Most frequent transaction type
   - Monthly spending patterns

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test with customer having single account
- [ ] Test with customer having multiple accounts (joint)
- [ ] Test with customer having fixed deposits
- [ ] Test with customer having no transactions
- [ ] Test with invalid NIC (should return 404)
- [ ] Test with expired/invalid token (should return 401)
- [ ] Verify all transaction totals are correct
- [ ] Verify net flow calculation is accurate
- [ ] Check that all monetary values are rounded to 2 decimals
- [ ] Verify no duplicate transactions in response

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Pagination
Add pagination for customers with many transactions:
```javascript
GET /api/customer/getCustomerDetails/:nic?page=1&limit=50
```

### 2. Date Filtering
Filter transactions by date range:
```javascript
GET /api/customer/getCustomerDetails/:nic?from=2024-01-01&to=2024-12-31
```

### 3. Transaction Type Filter
Get only specific transaction types:
```javascript
GET /api/customer/getCustomerDetails/:nic?types=deposits,withdrawals
```

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Add database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Use database aggregation functions instead of controller logic
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data

### 5. Additional Computed Fields
- Average transaction amount per category
- Transaction frequency (per day/week/month)
- Balance trend (increasing/decreasing)
- Spending velocity

### 6. Enhanced Net Balance
```javascript
net_balance = current_balance + pending_deposits - pending_withdrawals
```

## 📊 Data Flow

```
1. Frontend Request
   └─> GET /api/customer/getCustomerDetails/:nic with JWT

2. Backend Processing
   ├─> Validate JWT and extract user role
   ├─> Query database (customerModel.customerDetails)
   ├─> Group raw data by account_no
   ├─> Deduplicate transactions
   ├─> Compute category totals
   ├─> Calculate net flows
   └─> Structure DTO response

3. Frontend Reception
   ├─> Parse JSON response
   ├─> Display account summaries
   ├─> Show transaction breakdowns
   └─> Render financial analytics
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Endpoint requires JWT authentication
- Only 'customer' role can access
- NIC parameter should match authenticated user's NIC (add validation)
- All monetary calculations use parseFloat to prevent injection

---

## 📝 Code Quality

- ✅ No TypeScript/JavaScript errors
- ✅ Proper error handling with try/catch
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Clear code comments
- ✅ Modular structure (model/controller/route separation)
- ✅ Follows RESTful API design principles

## 🎓 Learning Points

1. **SQL Joins**: Used LEFT JOINs to combine data from multiple tables
2. **Data Aggregation**: Computed totals in JavaScript controller
3. **DTO Pattern**: Structured response for frontend consumption
4. **Transaction Deduplication**: Prevented duplicate data in response
5. **Calculation Logic**: Net flow and category totals formulas
