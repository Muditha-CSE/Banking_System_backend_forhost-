# Customer Details Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Customer Model Query (`src/models/customerModel.js`)

**Issues Fixed:**
- Changed comma to semicolon in WHERE clause
- Added `const result` to capture query result
- Fixed `GROUP BY` capitalization
- Added explicit column selection instead of `SELECT *`
- Added proper column aliases for clarity
- Fixed backslash line continuation issue
- Added ORDER BY to sort results properly

**New Query Features:**
- Explicit column naming for all transaction types
- Left joins for all transaction categories
- Proper filtering by transaction types (deposit/withdraw, savings/fd interest)
- Returns structured data ready for DTO mapping

### 2. Implemented Comprehensive Controller DTO (`src/controllers/customerControlller.js`)

**DTO Structure:**
The controller now returns a fully structured JSON response with:

```javascript
{
  customer_nic: "string",
  total_accounts: number,
  accounts: [
    {
      account_no: "string",
      role: "primary|secondary",
      savings_balance: number,
      savings_status: "string",
      fixed_deposits: [...],
      transactions: {
        transfers_sent: [...],
        transfers_received: [...],
        deposits: [...],
        withdrawals: [...],
        savings_interest: [...],
        fd_interest: [...]
      },
      summary: {
        current_balance: number,
        net_balance: number,
        total_fd_amount: number,
        transaction_totals: {
          transfers_sent: { count, total_amount },
          transfers_received: { count, total_amount },
          deposits: { count, total_amount },
          withdrawals: { count, total_amount },
          savings_interest: { count, total_amount },
          fd_interest: { count, total_amount }
        },
        net_transaction_flow: number
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Computation Logic:**

1. **Data Grouping:** Groups raw query results by account_no
2. **Transaction Deduplication:** Prevents duplicate transactions using transaction IDs
3. **Categorical Totals:** Computes sum and count for each transaction category:
   - Transfers Sent (outgoing)
   - Transfers Received (incoming)
   - Deposits (incoming)
   - Withdrawals (outgoing)
   - Savings Interest (incoming)
   - FD Interest (incoming)

4. **Net Balance Calculation:**
   - `current_balance`: Current savings account balance from DB
   - `net_balance`: Currently equals current_balance (can be enhanced)
   - `net_transaction_flow`: Calculated as:
     ```
     deposits + transfers_received + savings_interest + fd_interest 
     - withdrawals - transfers_sent
     ```

5. **Fixed Deposit Aggregation:** Sums all FD amounts linked to each account

### 3. Fixed Customer Routes (`src/routes/customerRoutes.js`)

**Issue Fixed:**
- Was importing from wrong controller (`adminController` instead of `customerControlller`)
- Now correctly imports from `customerControlller.js`
- Added proper export statement

### 4. Documentation (`docs/CUSTOMER_DETAILS_DTO.md`)

Created comprehensive documentation including:
- Complete DTO structure with types
- Explanation of each transaction category
- Computed field definitions
- Example response
- Frontend usage guidelines
- Implementation notes

## Transaction Categories Explained

1. **Transfers Sent**: Money sent from this account to another account (outgoing)
2. **Transfers Received**: Money received from another account (incoming)
3. **Deposits**: Cash deposits to the account (incoming)
4. **Withdrawals**: Cash withdrawals from the account (outgoing)
5. **Savings Interest**: Interest earned on savings balance (incoming)
6. **FD Interest**: Interest earned from fixed deposits (incoming)

## Net Balance Formula

```
Net Transaction Flow = 
  (Deposits + Transfers Received + Savings Interest + FD Interest) 
  - (Withdrawals + Transfers Sent)
```

This shows the net change in account balance from all transactions.

## Frontend Integration

The frontend can now:

1. **Display Overview Dashboard:**
   - Show all accounts with current balances
   - Display total FD investments
   - Show account roles (primary/secondary)

2. **Transaction History:**
   - List all transactions by category
   - Filter by transaction type
   - Sort by date

3. **Financial Analytics:**
   - Show pie charts of income vs expenses
   - Display transaction category breakdown
   - Calculate interest earned
   - Show transfer activity patterns

4. **Account Health Indicators:**
   - Net flow (positive/negative)
   - Transaction frequency
   - Balance trends

## API Endpoint

```
GET /api/customer/getCustomerDetails/:nic
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Role: customer
```

## Response Format

All monetary values are:
- Parsed as floats
- Rounded to 2 decimal places
- Returned as numbers (not strings)

## Error Handling

- 404: No accounts found for customer
- 500: Database or processing error
- Proper error messages in response

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with customer having:
   - Single account
   - Multiple accounts (joint accounts)
   - Account with FD
   - Account with no transactions
   - Account with all transaction types

2. Verify calculations:
   - Check totals match individual transaction sums
   - Verify net flow calculation
   - Confirm FD amounts are correct

3. Performance testing:
   - Test with high transaction volume
   - Check query performance
   - Verify deduplication works correctly
